/**
 * Class SENSOR is an abstract class which represents all kinds of physical stimuli that an organism can receive.
 * For example: touch, sound, light ...
 * This class does not represent a specific information - it just receives the outside event.
 * In case of a collision, a pressure-sensitive sensor is triggered and send a message to the nervous system of the
 * organism. The stimulus itself (The semantic interpretation of the message) is interpreted by the organism's brain.
 * The message does not carry any information.
 * This class represents the stimuli of one sensor / one receptor in the organism body.
