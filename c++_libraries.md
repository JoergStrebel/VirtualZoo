# C++ libraries

* iostream: The input/output library (io library) is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output. Weâ€™ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console. The io part of iostream stands for input/output.
* chrono: In 2011 C++ had a better default time library than almost every language.
* regex: C++ has built-in regex now and they're pretty damn good too.
* unique_ptr and shared_ptr: these implement various kinds of reference counting and enforcing memory ownership. Once these were added people largely stopped doing loads of heap allocation and instead now opt for more on the stack and only these pointers where needed.
* thread: Multi-threading is baked into the language by default.
* filesystem: Need to traverse the filesystem
